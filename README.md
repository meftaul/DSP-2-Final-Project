**Disclaimer:** The code presented here is purely for educational and experimental purposes. It is not structured, optimized, or intended for production use. The primary objective is to explore concepts, experiment with different approaches, and facilitate interactive learning for students. As a result, the code may lack best practices in software engineering, security, performance optimization, and maintainability. If you intend to use similar implementations in a production environment, it is highly recommended to refactor the code, follow industry standards, and conduct thorough testing.
